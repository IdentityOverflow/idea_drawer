## Example Structure

Each example follows this structure:

1. **Import required modules** from ro_framework
2. **Define DoFs** for the problem domain
3. **Create mapping functions** (world model, self model)
4. **Build observer** with boundary, mappings, resolution
5. **Demonstrate observations** with sample data
6. **Show key features** relevant to that example

## Next Steps

After exploring these examples:

1. Read the [theoretical framework](../ro_framework.md) for deep understanding
2. Check the [Python formalization](../python_formalization.md) for implementation details
3. Review the [API documentation](../docs/) (coming soon)
4. Try the [Jupyter notebooks](../notebooks/) for interactive learning (coming soon)
