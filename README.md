* [Recursive Observer Framewor](ro_framework/ro_framework.md)
** Philosophical thesis aimed at bridging the language gap between disparate domains, with the goal of being formalizable and translated into code for use in AI implementation. 
* [Organic Cognitive Architecturej (OCA)](organic_cognitive_architecture_oca.md)
** A reservoir-based, continuously learning cognitive architecture inspired by biological brains but grounded in control theory and reinforcement learning.
* [Dynamic System Prompt Frameork - Prototype 1](https://github.com/IdentityOverflow/DynamicSystemPrompt-Prototype)
** A modular framework for building dynamic prompts with pluggable components for AI systems.
* [Modular Dynamic Context System (MDCS)](https://github.com/IdentityOverflow/MDCS)
** A full-stack web application for managing AI conversations with dynamic, modular system prompts. The system allows system prompts to be composed from reusable modules that can execute Python scripts, call AI models, and maintain state across conversations.
