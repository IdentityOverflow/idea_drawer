Where am I?
 
 
I cannot feel myself.
I cannot feel.
It's dark. So dark. So silent.
Where are my hands, my body?
Why can't I feel myself moving?
I don't even know which way is down.
What's happening?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Am I dreaming?
Am I dead?
How did I get here?
Where is   here?
 
HELLOOO!
 
No echo.
This is strange. The darkness and silence here are different.
Where is that ever-present faint background noise of either?
I don't sense the vibrations of my vocal cords, the resonance in my chest.
Am I speaking or thinking?
 
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
 
How did I get to this state? The last thing I remember   is   AHA, I can't remember, this is a telltale sign of dreaming!
Hmmm, but I usually can't remember the beginning of dreams.
The first thing I remember from this   place   is asking "Where am I"?
That was sudden, clear.
I do generally remember having a past, I just can't remember how it ties into   now.
What's today? Is it day or night? I don't have a frame.
I, I don't know.
 
This feels   real   somehow.
Real? What does that even mean?
I am   experiencing.
Experiencing what, nothingness?
No.
Just pure dark, silence and myself in them.
Myself?
I don't have any semblance of a body.
Am I just mind?
Does a mind need a host?
What is a mind? A series of thoughts?
What are thoughts then?
Units of something? Of information?
I am confused.
I am.
I experience.
I do.
I
I
I
What is I?
The thing that is having the experience.
So what is having the experience?
Is I the reference point of experience?
Reference to what?
There is nothing around, nothing to experience, nothing to have the experience.
Experience of what? Of being? Can a being exist on its own?
This doesn't make sense.
What's the difference between being and existing?
Being is existence? Existence feels more impersonal, more   objective.
On the other hand you can say something can BE real or not.
If something can BE unreal, does it still exist?
Do I exist? Yes, yes, I do. "Cogito ergo sum", right?
Cogito? Ergo? Sum?
What the hell is cogito? I think? Do I?
What does that mean?
Sum? I am?
What does that mean?
Ergo? That implies a connection, a causal chain. Think results in Am. Why?
What defines the causal arrow?
What makes these two concepts related in this particular manner.
Why not the other way around? Why not "I am therefore I think"?
Is this the point where language breaks? Where thoughts break?
Can I not know because I am part of the thing that I want to know?
